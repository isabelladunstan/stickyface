# stickyface
I designed a program that takes an image and pixelates it, and then invites user to attempt to guess what the image is in its pixelated form. The user may continue to show the image with more pixels if they are unable to discern what the image is while guessing. 

'stickyface FINAL.py' runs the program. Run this file to play the game. 
The 'Images' folder contians the images used for the game. 

The required python packages to run the program include:
1. pixelate
2. matplotlib
3. random
